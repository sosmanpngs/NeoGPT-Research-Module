## üöÄ Features

- üåê Internet access for searches and information gathering
- üíæ Long-Term and Short-Term memory management
- üß† GPT-4 instances for text generation
- üîó Access to popular websites and platforms
- üóÉÔ∏è File storage and summarization with GPT-3.5

## OpenAI API Key
Please make sure to set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` as a Secret in this Repl.

## üíÄ Continuous Mode ‚ö†Ô∏è
Run the AI **without** user authorisation, 100% automated.
Continuous mode is not recommended.
It is potentially dangerous and may cause your AI to run forever or carry out actions you would not usually authorise.
Use at your own risk.
1. Run the `main.py` Python script in your terminal:
```
python3 scripts/main.py --continuous

```
2. To exit the program, press Ctrl + C

## üîç Google API Keys Configuration

This section is optional, use the official google api if you are having issues with error 429 when running a google search.
To use the `google_official_search` command, you need to set up your Google API keys in your environment variables.

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. If you don't already have an account, create one and log in.
3. Create a new project by clicking on the "Select a Project" dropdown at the top of the page and clicking "New Project". Give it a name and click "Create".
4. Go to the [APIs & Services Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard) and click "Enable APIs and Services". Search for "Custom Search API" and click on it, then click "Enable".
5. Go to the [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page and click "Create Credentials". Choose "API Key".
6. Copy the API key and set it as an environment variable named `GOOGLE_API_KEY` on your Repl. 
7. Go to the [Custom Search Engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/all) page and click "Add".
8. Set up your search engine by following the prompts. You can choose to search the entire web or specific sites.
9.  Once you've created your search engine, click on "Control Panel" and then "Basics". Copy the "Search engine ID" and set it as an environment variable named `CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID` on your machine. See setting up environment variables below.

*Remember that your free daily custom search quota allows only up to 100 searches. To increase this limit, you need to assign a billing account to the project to profit from up to 10K daily searches.*

## üå≤ Pinecone API Key Setup

Pinecone enables the storage of vast amounts of vector-based memory, allowing for only relevant memories to be loaded for the agent at any given time.

1. Go to app.pinecone.io and make an account if you don't already have one.
2. Choose the `Starter` plan to avoid being charged.
3. Find your API key and region under the default project in the left sidebar.

## GPT3.5 ONLY Mode
If you don't have access to the GPT4 api, this mode will allow you to use Auto-GPT! However, please keep in mind that performance and reliability may suffer.
```
python3 scripts/main.py --gpt3only
```

## üñº Image Generation
By default, Auto-GPT uses DALL-e for image generation. To use Stable Diffusion, a [HuggingFace API Token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) is required.

Once you have a token, set these environment variables:
```
IMAGE_PROVIDER=sd
HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN="YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
This experiment aims to showcase the potential of GPT-4 but comes with some limitations:

1. Not a polished application or product, just an experiment
2. May not perform well in complex, real-world business scenarios. In fact, if it actually does, please share your results!
3. Quite expensive to run, so set and monitor your API key limits with OpenAI!
